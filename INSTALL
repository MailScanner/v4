Quick Start Installation Instructions
=====================================

The paths used within MailScanner assume, by default, that it is installed
into /opt/MailScanner, except on Linux systems where you will find the
configuration files in /etc/MailScanner.

Once you have run the ./install.sh file in the distribution, if you are
using sendmail you can just start it up and it will run with a sensible
set of default settings.

First thing to add to it is ClamAV (free virus scanner engine) and
SpamAssassin (free anti-spam engine) which you can install by using the
easy-to-install ClamAV and SpamAssassin package you can download from the
MailScanner web site at www.mailscanner.info/downloads.html. This package
really is worth using rather than doing it all yourself, it installs all
the other packages required, edits the configuration files so they actually
work, installs all the automatic update mechanisms, all sorts of things
like that to make your life easier.

But if you are a true martyr and insist on doing everything by hand, have
fun doing all the hard work yourself but don't come running to me when you
can't make it work! :-)
